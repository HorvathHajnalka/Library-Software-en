In the documentation of the library lending system, we listed activities performed by various actors. Among these actors, we find the administrator, the librarian, and the reader, each with their own role and responsibilities in using the system.

The administrator is a key figure in the system. They are responsible for adding new borrowers and librarians to the system. Additionally, they can modify the data of existing borrowers and librarians, ensuring that the information is always up to date. If a borrower or librarian is no longer active, the administrator can delete their profile. Managing permissions is also the administrator's task, ensuring that only users with appropriate permissions access certain functions.

Librarians are the daily users of the library lending system. They handle the books and related tasks. By querying available books, they assist readers in finding the desired books. Through search and filtering options, they can easily find relevant works for readers. Librarians manage the lending and renewal of books. They expand the library's offerings by adding new books and update book data if necessary. If a book becomes irrelevant or outdated, they can remove it from the system.

For readers, the system provides a convenient tool for utilizing library services. The reservation function helps them secure a book before others. By querying available books, they can easily find reading material of interest. The search and filtering functions aid in quickly locating books on desired topics. If readers wish to extend the loan period of a book, they can request it through the system. If they incur late fees, they can also pay them through the system. Readers also have the option to pay membership fees.

Users have access to login and logout functions to securely use the system.

This software allows each participant to efficiently use library services and handle tasks associated with their role. Whether they are administrators, librarians, or readers, they can find functions in the system that suit their needs and responsibilities.
