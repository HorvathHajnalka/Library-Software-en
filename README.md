# Library Management System

Welcome to the Library Management System, a software solution designed for managing library operations with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

This system is accompanied by detailed documentation, including activity diagrams, use case tables, and a class diagram, to provide a clear overview of its functionality and architecture.
